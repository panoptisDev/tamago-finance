# Tamago Finance [WIP]

## Overview

We aim to build a PMM-based perpetual swap protocol (PMM - Proactive Market Making Algorithm introduced by DODOex) for non-crypto derivatives such as stocks, financial indicators and more as the current DeFi derivatives market is seems limited to crypto assets while the industry might need to move forward in order to achieve mass adoption and to unlock the full potential of decentralized finance technology, we have to narrow the gap between CeFi and DeFi by allowing more assets to be traded in derivatives market. 

The PMM-based model can ensure better trading experience that easily scale to support hundreds pairs without the need of intervention by admin or DAO in contrast to AMM-based perpetual protocol that would need to adjust K constant from time to time.
